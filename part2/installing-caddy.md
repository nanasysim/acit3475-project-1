# Part 2: Local Deployment and Portfolio Setup
## Step 1: Installing Caddy Locally
1. Install Caddy on your local machine (Windows, Linux, or Mac).
   - For Windows, download the installer from the [Caddy GitHub Page](https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/releases) or go to the [Caddy website](https://caddyserver.com/docs/install) for installation instructions.

2. Verify the installation by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
    ```
    caddy --version
    ```
This command should return the version of Caddy you have installed. If it does, congratulations! You have successfully installed Caddy on your local machine.
