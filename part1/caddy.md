# Caddy: A Modern Web Server
## Introduction to Caddy
### What is Caddy, and Why Was It Created?

In 2015, Matthew Holt recognized the need for a simpler and more automated approach to web server management, which was traditionally handled by servers like Apache and Nginx. 

He created Caddy aiming to simplify the process of setting up and managing web servers for developers and system administrators. Caddy does this by automating tedious tasks, such as HTTPS configuration, certificate management, and providing sensible defaults for common use cases. 

Caddy is open-source and written in Go (Golang), making it lightweight, fast, and easy to deploy.

Caddy is designed to be simple, secure, and efficient, with a focus on ease of use, security, and performance.
